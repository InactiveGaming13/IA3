The point of this project is to create a simple website for the AHSHS video game club using the RAWG API. 
The website will display a list of games that the club can play, and will allow users to search for games by name. 
The website will also display detailed information about each game, including the game's cover image, description, and rating.
The website will use a flask backend and a super simple javascript frontend.
